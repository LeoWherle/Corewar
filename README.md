## Goal:
  Corewar project is a virtual machine that can execute a bytecode file to make a fight between champions in a virtual RAM. The bytecode file is generated by an assembler. The assembler is a program that can translate an assembly file into a bytecode file. The assembly file called a champion is a file that contains instructions that can be executed by the virtual machine.
