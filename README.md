## Goal:
  Corewar project is a virtual machine that can execute a bytecode file to make a fight between champions in a virtual RAM. The bytecode file is generated by an assembler. The assembler is a program that can translate an assembly file into a bytecode file. The assembly file called a champion is a file that contains instructions that can be executed by the virtual machine.

## Showcase:

## Requirements :
  - gcc or clang

## How to use:

### Terminal

    $ ./asm/asm file_name.s

    $ ./corewar/corewar [-dump nbr_cycle] [[-n prog_number] [-a load_address ] prog_name] ...

### Graphical

  on branch, **main** : *takes the "default" champions for demonstration*

    $ make bonus

  on branch, **tournament** :

    $ ./corewar.sh [-dump nbr_cycle] [[-n prog_number] [-a load_address ] prog_name] ...
